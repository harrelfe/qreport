Author: Frank Harrell
Maintainer: Frank Harrell <fh@fharrell.com>
Description: Provides statistical components, tables, and graphs
    that are useful in 'Quarto' and 'RMarkdown' reports and that produce 'Quarto'
    elements for special formatting such as tabs and marginal notes and graphs.
    Some of the functions produce entire report sections with tabs, e.g.,
    the missing data report created by missChk().  Functions for inserting
		variables and tables inside 'graphviz' and 'mermaid' diagrams are included,
		and so are special clinical trial graphics for adverse event reporting.
